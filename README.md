# captcha

Question

Build a client-side captcha. Showcase this functionality in a sign-up form.

Must-haves:

- Do NOT use a pre-built captcha.
- Do NOT use any third-party libraries. Everything has to be built from scratch.
- Use either vanila Javascript or React.

Goo-to-have:

- Responsiveness (i.e. a good-looking and usable mobile view)
- Having meta tags for link previews.
- Dark mode
