Project Title: Building a Client-side Captcha for Sign-up Form

Objective: To develop a user-friendly and secure client-side captcha for a sign-up form using vanilla JavaScript.

Approach:

Developed a custom captcha module that generates random characters.
Implemented a validation mechanism that checks if the user input matches the generated captcha.
Designed a responsive and mobile-friendly user interface that adapts to different screen sizes.
Added meta tags for link previews and optimized the webpage for better SEO performance.
Implemented a dark mode feature that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes.

Technologies Used:

HTML/CSS for UI design and layout.
Vanilla JavaScript for implementing captcha generation, validation, and user interaction.
Git for version control and collaboration.
Netlify for hosting and deployment.

Outcome:

The project resulted in a fully functional client-side captcha that improves the security of the sign-up form by preventing automated bots from submitting spam requests. The captcha also enhances the user experience by providing an engaging and interactive way to complete the sign-up process. The responsive design and dark mode features provide additional usability and accessibility benefits for users.
